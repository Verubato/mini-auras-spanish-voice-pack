# MiniAurasVoicePackSpanish - bot reference

Version 1.0.1. Interface version 120100. No saved variables, no options UI,
no slash commands.

## What it does

Adds two Spanish voices, **Miguel** (male, middle-aged, deep and cinematic)
and **Kate** (female, young, bright and clear), to the voice pack dropdown in
MiniAuras' Alerts settings. They speak the Spanish spell names for the same
announcements the shipped English voices cover: important cooldowns,
defensive cooldowns, and enemy debuffs.

Both voices are Latin American Spanish. A player on a Spain client hears a
Latin American accent, which is worth knowing before installing.

The addon is audio plus one registration call. It draws nothing, stores
nothing, and does not change how or when MiniAuras announces.

## How it works

- Ships one OGG per announced spell name under `Sounds\Miguel\` and
  `Sounds\Kate\`, using the same file names as MiniAuras' own packs.
- Hands both folders to MiniAuras through
  `MiniAurasApi.v1:RegisterVoicePack`, tagged for the `esES` and `esMX`
  client locales.
- MiniAuras is an optional dependency, so it normally loads first. If it has
  not, the addon waits on ADDON_LOADED and registers as soon as the API
  appears.

## Settings

None of its own. The voice is picked in MiniAuras under **Alerts → Voice
pack**, and the choice is saved by MiniAuras.

## Troubleshooting

**"The voices are not in the dropdown."** They are offered on Spanish
clients only. On any other client the dropdown shows MiniAuras' English
voices instead. The names stay reserved everywhere, so a saved
setting still means this pack when the player switches back to a Spanish
client.

**"The dropdown is empty of Spanish voices but the addon is enabled."** Check
MiniAuras itself is installed and enabled, and is recent enough to have the
voice pack API (5.2.0 and later).

**"A spell announces in English."** That name had no Spanish entry when the
clips were rendered; the generator falls back to the English name and says
so. Re-running the two scripts fixes it.

**"The announcement is not what my client calls the spell."** Deliberate for
about forty names. Long names are cut down to the part players react to, and
six ids are announced on the aura rather than the cast, so the client's name
for them belongs to a different ability.

**"The wording is not what a Latin American client shows."** The clips are
rendered from the Spain client's names. The two clients agree on most spells,
but around twenty are worded differently and are announced the Spain way.
